# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarte data to uncover trends
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First we have a database with 4113 titles of different recreational content such as film & video, plays, musicals and so on. We have a brew description of wath is about each one and the coutrys where there were watch. They have and identificator and important information for an investor like goal, pledged, if it was a success or a failed, if they had backerys before and the time they were released or were playing. Also they have an important column that tell us the percentage of return based on the invest and the profit.

Some analysis were made with this information:
1. Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  Basically the analysis were about if the time of the year was significally on the launchig date to the outcome, the answer were yes and the best month to launch      something is on May.

2. Then the analysis were focus on the type of content and see wich one is more successful than the others
  First the focus were on the category, the result was that teather is more successful than the other categories

  Then the focus were on the subcategory, were the result was that plays are more successful than the others
  ![Subcategory Statistics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21062253/135365090-0f55fe2b-2a59-4686-b6b4-db6a87aa9bba.png)
  
  In conclusion we can say based on the results that if you want to launch something, you should lauch a teather play.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So the information is clear, plays is the best option to take, but how much do we can spect to earn in an especific country such as US, well using descriptive statistics is possible to see the data behaviour on what's the goal and the pledge

The result was that in a successful scenario the results beetween what is espect vs what is the real result don't vary significantly, obviously when it is failed they does, but in general you earn what you spect.

Finally it is important to know how to invest, for this analysis the focus were on Great Britain because on of our invest wanted to launch a musical in this country, so the decision was to made a boxplot to see what was the smartest investment.

Here we can see that the smartest invest should be under Â£2000.
